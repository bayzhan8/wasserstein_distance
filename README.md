# Wasserstein Distance
A Python (cvxpy) implementation of a linear program that computes the Wasserstein distance between two probability density matrices using customizable distance functions. 
The Wasserstein distance, also known as the Earth Mover's Distance, is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions over a region.
